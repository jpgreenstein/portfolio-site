			<h2>What up</h2>
			<h3>My parents named me Justin â€“ you can call me that.</h3>
			<p>Originally from a small town in SW Florida called Cape Coral, I currently reside in Tallahassee, FL. I moved here in 2009 to study Studio Art and Design at Florida State University. Since then, Tallahassee has proven to be a beautiful, growing city with a variety of opportunities to apply and expand my creative interests. As I continue to meet cool people and work on interesting projects, I've found there to be one thing consistent with all endeavours - the inevitable process. The process of bringing to life ideas and connecting with an audience is one that I thoroughly enjoy. I believe we all have the potential to contribute to this progressive society by sharing our individual wealth of knowledge and genuine perspective. With this philosophy in mind, my services are a humble means of contribution. <br>
			Great ideas live inside all of us. Sometimes they just need a way to breathe life into them. If the timing is right, I would be more that happy to go through that process with you. If you'd like to chat, feel free to shoot me an email. I always enjoy meeting new people.</p>
